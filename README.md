# Model-Based-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Quantum-Decision-Agents.
Implementation of a model-based reinforcement learning framework integrating quantum decision agents. Compares classical DDPG, DDPG + HER, and Quantum RL approaches for path-planning and control tasks to evaluate learning efficiency and policy diversity.
